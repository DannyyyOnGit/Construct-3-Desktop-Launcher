[h2]Construct 3 Launcher - Q&A[/h2]
[b]► What are the system requirements?[/b]
Windows 95+ ; ~5mb disk space; 30mb RAM; DirectX 9.0c

[b]► Why do I need this, what has been made more "simple"?[/b]
Construct 3 Desktop users are currently required to opt into the stable channel or beta channel version of C3 Desktop. This launcher makes things easier and doesn't require any specific release channel.

[b]► Which Construct 3 Desktop release channel version do I need?[/b]
It doesn't matter. The launcher works with any release channel version of Construct 3 Desktop.

[b]► Do I always have to use the C3 launcher now?[/b]
No! You just have to launch a release once. Construct 3 Desktop will always run based on that decision.

[b]► Can I keep using Construct 3 Desktop by directly running project files?[/b]
Yes! Once you've launched the release version you like, you can keep running Construct 3 Desktop, by directly clicking on the executable or project files (e.g. c3p files).
